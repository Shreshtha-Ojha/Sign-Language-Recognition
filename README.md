# Sign Language Recognition System (AI/ML)

A comprehensive Sign Language Recognition system exploring multiple deep learning and computer vision approaches including CNNs, ANN, MediaPipe-based hand landmark detection, and continuous gesture recognition.

---

## Project Motivation

Communication barriers faced by the hearing- and speech-impaired community remain a significant challenge.  
This project aims to reduce that gap by leveraging computer vision and machine learning to recognize sign language gestures and convert them into meaningful outputs.

---

## Repository Overview

This repository is designed as a combined research and implementation project.  
Multiple approaches were implemented, evaluated, and compared to understand their effectiveness in real-time sign language recognition.

---

## Implemented Approaches

- CNN-based static sign language recognition  
- ANN-based gesture classification  
- MediaPipe hand landmark–based recognition  
- Continuous sign language recognition pipeline  
- Game-based learning modules for improved user engagement
